## Introduction 
This is a VR archery game that aims to let users practice the skill of archery considering the weight of bows, the distance of the targets, among other environment conditions.

### Locomotion Technique

Our locomotion technique is walking. 
For an archery game, the main task for users is to learn the posture of arms and hands, so we do not want to make the learning environment overcomplicated with extra locomotions. Besides, incorperating walking in our archery game also aligns with the nature of the game in reality.
